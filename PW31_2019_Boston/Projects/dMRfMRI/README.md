## Key Investigators

- Laura Leung (BWH)
- Fan Zhang (Brigham and Women's Hospital)
- Lauren J O'Donnell (Brigham and Women's Hospital)

# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->
Curate data for future machine learning and data analysis projects.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. A curated dataset with expert-thresholded and labled fMRI tasks.
1. Instructions on how to curate this data to add to the dataset in the future.


## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. Get the data
1. Work with Laura on thresholding
1. Make a curation plan and instructions
1. Process fMRI data
1. Label fMRI activations
1. Curate files in designated file organization
