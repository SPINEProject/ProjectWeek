# Placenta Flattening and Visualization in Slicer

## Key Investigators

- Mazdak Abulnaga (MIT)
- Steve Pieper (Isomics)
- Polina Golland (MIT)

# Project Description

The project aims to develop a module in Slicer to visualize placenta shapes embedded in MR images. We will use the transformations described in
"Placental Flattening via Volumetric Parameterization" by Abulnaga et al. (arXiV) that map placentae shapes embedded in in-utero MRI to
a flattened canonical template. The goal is to use the transformation tensor to be able to easily map between the original image space and the canonical space.
