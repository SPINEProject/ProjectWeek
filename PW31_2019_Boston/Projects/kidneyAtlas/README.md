## Key Investigators

- Babacar Diao (Ecole Militaire de Santé Dakar)
- Nayra Pumar (ULPGC – GTMA-IUIBS - MACbioIDi)
- Juan Ruiz-Alzola (ULPGC - GTMA-IUIBS - MACbioIDi)


## Project Description

This project focuses on the development of an anatomical atlas of the kidney and male urinary system, along with an improved version of the male pelvic atlas.


## Objectives

1.	To segment the anatomical models using 3D Slicer (images provided by Dr. Babacar Diao).
1.	To update the current segmentation of the male pelvic anatomy using 3D Slicer (images provided by Dr. Babacar Diao).
1.	To export the vtk models obtained from the segmentation into the openanatomy structure using the web atlas editor.
1.	To export the vtk models obtained from the segmentation to .obj format, and assemble them into an Open Anatomy atlas using the Atlas aSsembly Tool (AST)


## Approach and Plan

1.	Training using the 3D Slicer segment editor
1.	Image study and selection
1.	Use the export tools in 3D Slicer


## Progress and Next Steps
