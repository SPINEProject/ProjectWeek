# Project Description

The orbitofrontal-subgenual circuitry is important for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) using non-invasive treatments in psychiatry, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or invasive neurosurgical approaches such as Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS). The anatomical structures involved in this circuitry are the orbitofrontal cortex, Brodmann’s area 11(BA 11), the Subcallosal area, BA 25 and the fiber tract that interconnects these two cortical areas, namely the frontopolar bundle. The two cortical areas of this circuitry can be targets for TMS procedures or DBS interventions.

## Objective

1. We will segment the orbitofrontal cortex and the subcallosal area using SLICER in the individual subject brain using T1 MRI data.
2. We will connect these two cortical regions using the tractographic white matter query language (WMQL) software on diffusion MRI data of the same subject.
