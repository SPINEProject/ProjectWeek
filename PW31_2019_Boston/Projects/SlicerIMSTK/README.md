# Project Description

For this project, we are working on integrating the Interactive Medical Simulation Toolkit (iMSTK) into a Slicer extension.

## Objective

Our goal for poject week is to have a working extension that demos an iMSTK simulation

## Approach and Plan

1. Build iMSTK libraries through a superbuild extension
2. Create a loadable module that initializes an iMSTK simulation
3. Link that simulation inputs/outputs to Slicer
4. Display the progress of the simulation through Slicer

## Progress and Next Steps
