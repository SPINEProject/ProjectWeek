# OHIF Viewer Plugin Architecture

## Key Investigators

## Description

The [OHIF Viewer][ohif-viewer] is a zero-footprint medical image viewer provided by the [Open Health Imaging Foundation][ohif] (OHIF). It is a configurable and extensible progressive web application with out-of-the-box support for image archives which support DICOMweb. We would like to make the OHIF Viewer easier to extend and customize in order to better support the workflow and feature needs of end users.

## Objective

Some amount of extensibility is available via OHIF [existing extensions][ohif-extensions]. Our objective is specific to our overarching goal of integrating [James A Petts][james] existing Segmentation tools and UI, currently maintained [here][james-magic]. For example, we would like it to be possible to add the following via plugins:

```bash
# INSERT COOL IMAGES OF JAMES'S STUFF HERE
```

1. Support for custom Commands, Hotkeys, and User Preferences
2. Support for custom Side Panels
3. Support for custom Toolbar Buttons
4. Create and publish `@ohif/extension-segmentation`
